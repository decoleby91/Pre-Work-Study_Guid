# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description
My motivation for this project was to learn from the assigned tasks in order to be well prepared for the course.
I built this project in order to fufil a long time dream of actual making a simple web site and to also begin a bigger dream of becoming a web developer, something that has eluded me for the past 6-10 years.
The project initially tackles the problem of teaching me the very basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript which I'd tried to do in the past to no avail.
I learnt the very basics of HTML,CSS, and JavaScript, Githib, some basic Linux commands.
